1 Development
-------------

For development, use the export URL parameter as follows:

https://www.draw.io?export=http://localhost:8080/export

Where the latter can use any URL without the http prefix.

2 Deployment
------------

The build.xml Ant script will use the mxgraph-core.jar from ../../war/WEB-INF.
The war file does not depend on any special APIs and can be deployed to any
servlet container.
